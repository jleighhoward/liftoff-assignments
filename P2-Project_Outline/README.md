## Submission Instructions

### Overview
According to Food Allergy Reseacrh there has been a 377% increase in anaphylactic reactions since 2007, and every 3 minutes a food allergy sends someone to the emergecy room. Most of these situations involve childeren who don't have much say in what ends up on their plate. Between what foods are safe and what information the doctor needs there has to be a solution. The application I'm working on will be able to document safe and allergen foods for indiviual children, as well as the reactions they cause and what to do if consumed. I also plan to implement the capability of documenting the introduction of new foods and the noted reaction with time stamps. I also want to include more rescources for people who deal with allergies such as blogs, recipies, and restaurant lists. All of this will be based around the eight main allergen foods.
### Features

### Technologies

SPRINGBOOT
ANGULAR
STORMPATH API for authorization purposes?-- needs more reseacrh before officially decided
Possibly a Facebook API - unsure of what that entails and displays??
Possibly a Recipe API

### What I'll Have to Learn

# MY USER STORY:
"As a parent of a child with severe allergies, I want to be able to log foods that have caused allergic reactions and foods that are safe for my child to recieve so that myself and others can easily reference and document to make simple things such as meal time but also more difficult things such as relaying information to doctors and caregivers more effective and percise."
